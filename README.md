# The Automaton for FWS
The FWS CPI Automaton is an Ansible playbook intended to be used to update Git repositories associated with customers of [Filecoin Web Services](https://fw.services).

It's open source and built in such a way that with some effort, you can run your own FWS infrastructure and even take on paying customers if you wanted to.

The Automaton is intended to be used with the CPI Helm charts for FWS, which will allow you to dynamically and fully automatically provision infrastructure.
